A \"living\" systematic review is not a static publication in a peer-reviewed journal but a review that resides on a website,  allowing for more frequent updates and easier access to information. This project is accessible at https://livestock-lsr.shinyapps.io/LivingSR/. It is updated every three months, most recently in September 2023. The January 2024 update is pending. This web-based platform is designed to provide the latest summaries of available studies to producers, public health officers, community leaders, and community members.

As part of this endeavor, we aimed to offer a balanced interpretation of the findings and their broader implications to better serve the community's needs. Our primary finding reveals that the published research in this field presents several limitations that hinder our ability to draw a conclusion regarding the association between exposure to AFOs and health outcomes. The major issues are:."),

Analyzing factors associated with existing cases can lead to inaccurate conclusions. A notable analogy is studying the causes of new HIV/AIDS cases. Suppose a research group investigates factors related to existing cases of HIV. In that case, they might find an association with \"higher incomes\" suggesting that those with higher incomes are more likely to be HIV positive. However, it would be incorrect to conclude that higher incomes cause people to contract HIV. In reality, higher incomes likely contribute to longer survival with HIV, resulting in a higher number of cases in people with higher incomes compared to people with lower incomes. This issue is known as prevalence bias. In the context of AFOs and community health, many studies (16 out of 30) measured disease prevalence, making it challenging to determine if the duration of an \"asthma diagnosis\" is the same for individuals exposed to AFOs compared to those who are not. This question differs from investigating whether exposure to AFOs causes asthma. Fewer recent studies have attempted to address this issue by focusing on the acute incidence of diseases, such as the number of hospitalizations due to asthma in the past year."),

For 56% of the effect sizes extracted from cross-sectional studies and 39% of the effect sizes extracted from case-control studies, the effect measure reported, in our opinion, could not have been interpreted as a metric of incidence."),

However, in the case of AFOs and human disease, achieving a single consistent exposure has proven challenging in current studies. Current research employs four broad measures of exposure: distance of a person's residence from the AFO, density of AFOs in the area, odor from AFOs, and emissions from AFOs (e.g., sulfur, ammonia, and particulate matter), and imputed estimates based on a combination of distance, wind patterns, and emissions. This inconsistency in exposure measurement hinders our ability to conclude causation. For example, exposure to emissions at 5 kilometers upwind of a farm may differ from exposure at the same distance downwind. Consequently, we cannot accurately assess the magnitude of the impact of an AFO on community health, i.e., whether the association is strong, weak, or non-existent. Understanding the size of an effect is crucial for policy decisions, as they involve balancing benefits and harms. Currently, we have prepared manuscripts on this topic to raise awareness of this limitation, in hopes that future studies will address it, maximizing the value of investments in research on this subject.

Two such factors are the presence of medical deserts (regions with low access to health care) and income levels. Areas where AFOs can legally be located are often the same areas that lack medical facilities (hospitals, health clinics, etc.). Deciding which factors to account for can be complex. We used a method called a directed acyclic graph, which illustrates, based on the best available scientific knowledge, proposed linkages between various factors and both AFO exposure and human health. Interestingly, we discovered that the majority of studies did not adequately explain why they controlled for certain factors, and when compared to a previously published directed acyclic graph, they did not control for the correct factors. This lack of clarity in reporting makes it challenging to conclude that the results represent a true picture of the relationship between living near an AFO and community health. As for our previous points, we have published materials on this issue to raise awareness, aiming to encourage future studies to address this limitation and enhance the value of research investments in this area."),

Findings regarding the temporal relationship between exposure and outcome were mixed, with studies where it was possible to infer measurement of exposure before the outcomes, studies that assessed exposure and outcome concurrently, and others where lack of reporting prevented temporality inferences. None of the measures of exposure captured an individual exposure to a metric of AFOs exposure such as personal exposure to ammonia levels. The authors did not discuss the consistency assumption."),
